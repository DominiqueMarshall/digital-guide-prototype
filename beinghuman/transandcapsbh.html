        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This gallery explores how we think and feel about ourselves, our bodies and our relationship with the world around us. Our understanding of what it means to be human is being transformed: by new research, our own experiences and those of other people. In this shifting landscape, who do we trust? Whose voices are heard? How do we see ourselves – and each other?

        The objects here are grouped around themes of genetics, minds and bodies, infection and environmental breakdown. They highlight diverse perspectives and overlapping identities: disabled people, artists, activists, scientists. We are all unique, but we are also all connected, living in a shared world.</p>

                    <P>Designers Kellenberger–White worked with artist Jochen Holz to create letterforms that evoke organic forms and a human touch. These hand-blown letters are made with thick amber glass. Their fluffy glow comes from helium rather than neon, the gas more usually associated with title signs. This sets off the gentle irregularities of the coloured glass, making visible the artist’s handiwork.</p>

                    <p>Our genetic code, or genome, is the blueprint of life. It provides instructions that shape every cell in the body. Revolutionary advances in research are transforming our understanding of how our bodies are made and why diseases occur. Genome editing – the ability to make precise changes to tiny sections of the genome – is opening up the hope of innovative medical treatments.

                    As so much seems possible, the objects in this section explore our hopes and fears about this knowledge. How much do we want to know or share about our own genetic identity?</p>

                    The surfaces and shapes of these jars each suggest a different health condition that can be inherited: the spots of acne, the brittle bones of osteoporosis, the rapid cell division of cancer or the flaky skin of psoriasis or ichthyosis. Just as we might inherit the family’s antique vase, so too might we inherit these ‘medical heirlooms’.</p>

                    <p>With thanks to the Lacks family

                    This image depicts Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman whose cancer cells transformed medical research, saving countless lives. The vial contains some of Lacks’s cells, which were immortal due to a genetic mutation, and continued to divide outside her body. Given the name the HeLa cell line, they were originally cultivated without the knowledge of Lacks or her family. Lacks’s story raises important questions about consent, privacy and our relationship to our complex genetic inheritance.</p>

                    <p>This is the first ultraportable genetic sequencer to be used in NHS hospitals. Identifying viruses and bacteria from their genetic material means patients receive the right treatment quicker. This can help hospitals to find the source of infections such as MRSA. Portable sequencers also allow scientists to conduct research in remote locations, such as the Ecuadorean rainforest or the International Space Station.</p>

                    <h4>Visual installation transcription</h4>
                    <p>For most of Western history, strong feelings of joy and sorrow, desire or hatred, hope and despair were thought of as “passions of the soul”. The powerful passions were distinguished from milder affections and sentiments, including familial love and compassion. Our modern category of ‘the emotions', is a much more recent invention. So how did we get from passions to emotions, and what difference has it made?</p>

                    <p>The word ‘emotion’ entered the English language from the French émotion in the 17th century. It meant a kind of physical agitation or commotion. So you might talk about the ‘emotion’ of a tree, meaning the wind was rustling its leaves, or a great ‘emotion’ among the people, meaning a public disturbance. ‘Emotion' only took on its modern, psychological meaning in the 19th century, as part of a self-consciously scientific approach to the mind.</p>

                    <p>The Scottish philosopher, who I think of as the inventor of the emotions, was Dr Thomas Brown, who died in 1820. Later pioneers, including Charles Darwin and William James, adopted Brown’s terminology and applied it to the new science of psychology.</p>

                    <p>Ever since then, scientists of the mind have tended to lump together all our feelings, sentiments, passions and affections in the capacious category of ‘the emotions’.</p>

                    <p>What difference has that made? There are two main legacies.</p>

                    <p>First, passions and affections were understood in moral terms – as good or evil. ‘The emotions', by contrast, were formed in a more secular and scientific spirit. They weren’t good or evil; they were inherited bodily inclinations – neither good nor bad in their own right, but just natural.</p>

                    <p>The second legacy is to do with the relationship between thinking and feeling. Earlier theories included categories that were both rational and emotional. So, for instance ‘affections’ and ‘sentiments’ combined reason with passion, light with heat.</p>

                    <p>The new category of ‘the emotions’, however, was from the outset starkly contrasted with the intellectual states of the mind. In this way, the contrast between the head and the heart became even more firmly entrenched.</p>

                    <p>So the next time you talk about experiencing an ‘emotion’, remember that people haven’t always talked, and written, this way. Maybe what you’re feeling is a passion, or an affection, or a sentiment, instead?</p>

                     <p>We are standing in front of a large book of prints. It includes black-and-white illustrations of the facial expressions drawn by the French painter Charles Le Brun.</p>

                    <p>The illustrations capture different “passions” of the soul. </p>

                    <p>They were first created by Le Brun in 1668. He believed that the human soul showed its “passions” in the movements   of the face, and he created a visual classification system to support his idea.</p>

                    <p>This went on to be influential for many centuries.</p>

                    <p>On this open page, there is an image of a woman with a serene expression on her face. The title below describes it as a depiction of “Joy with Tranquillity”.</p>

                    <p>Underneath the image, a short caption reads: “Very little alteration is remarked in the face of those that feel within themselves the sweetness of joy.”</p>

                    <p>This suggests that the lack of any stronger expression was regarded positively. Le Brun’s work went on to declare that it was possible to judge the moral character of a person based on the way they expressed their passions. </p>

                    <p>Le Brun was, like many other 17th-century thinkers of the time, interested in rationalising, ordering and explaining the world around him. By giving names and definitions to subjective human experiences, they set in motion the deeply rooted concept of human expression as universal, and position these expressions within a hierarchy of good and bad, a system which we are still grappling with to this day. </p>

                    <h3>Transcription</h3>
                        <p>As you enter the gallery, you walk down a corridor. On the walls and floor are black-and-white photographs of dancers printed onto yellow vinyl.</p>

                        <p>There is a large black-and-white projection ahead of you with four dancers, each depicted against a blank wall. All the walls in the gallery are painted yellow, the colour of happiness.</p>

                        <p>The dancers on the projection are involved in a hypnotic trance-like movement. To the right of the projection are a series of flat-screen monitors installed vertically at different angles. Two of them are on the walls, and the other two are on poles, forming a semi-enclosed circle.</p>

                        <p>The display creates a sense of intimacy with the performers. Each of them depicted in their own home but brought together in the gallery. Social intimacy broaching physical distance.</p>

                        <p>Each screen displays a performer participating in a movement workshop, devised by myself and the choreographer Vânia Gala. The dancers are moving to a series of scores that act as prompts. These include shaking, passing out and turning, and the movements are variously vigorous and intense, and then slow.</p>

                        <p>The workshop was originally intended to happen in the same place, but we did it online due to lockdown measures, which means each participant is performing on their own at home, the installation forming a type of surrogate dance floor in which you as the viewer are participating. The films are edited so you can start and stop watching whenever you want.</p>
