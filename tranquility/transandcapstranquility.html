        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Humans have long sought tranquillity by withdrawing from life’s distractions to experience gentler states of mind. Tranquillity relates to many other feelings, including contentment, serenity, peace and balance.</p>
        <p> Two newly commissioned installations explore contrasting experiences of tranquillity. Jasleen Kaur invites you to relax in a yoga studio while reflecting on themes of cultural appropriation in the self-care industry. Chrystel Lebas’s multisensory installation features some of the oldest forests in the world, translating the awe of being in these ancient landscapes. Both projects ask us to think deeply about our own wellbeing and our interdependence on other beings.</p>
        <p>At the centre of ‘Tranquillity’ is a room of contemporary artworks and historic artefacts that reveal different approaches to regulating the body and balancing the mind. From seeking solitude to being outside, employing prayer or self-reflection, we contemplate some of the spaces and rituals that can help us navigate fluctuating feelings and cope with uncertainty. Situated throughout the gallery are contributions from artists, religious leaders, historians, psychiatrists and neuroscientists, which consider the impact on our health of feeling calm.</p>
        <blockquote class="quote"><p>“For most of Western history, strong feelings of joy and sorrow, desire or hatred, hope and despair were thought of as passions of ‘the soul’. The powerful passions were distinguished from milder affections and sentiments, including familial love and compassion. Our modern category of ‘the emotions’ is a much more recent invention. So, how did we get from passions to emotions, and what difference has it made?”</p>

                    <p>Heads. Representing the various passions of the soul; as they are expressed in the human countenance / [Charles Le Brun].</p>

	                	</a>
                    <p>This engraving is a reproduction from painter Charles Le Brun’s drawings of the passions, which he presented at a lecture in 1688, later published and widely distributed among artists around Europe. Le Brun believed that the passions of the soul each produced a different facial expression.</p> 
                    <p>These were used to create a visual dictionary for artists to copy from. This page depicts the idealised state of “joy with tranquillity”. This was a polite and serene expression, with the sweetness of joy shown in a composed expression, which was morally preferable to raucous laughter.</p>

	                     <p>We are standing in front of a large book of prints. It includes black-and-white illustrations of the facial expressions drawn by the French painter Charles Le Brun.</p>

						 <p>The illustrations capture different “passions” of the soul. They were first created by Le Brun in 1668. He believed that the human soul showed its “passions” in the movements of the face, and he created a visual classification system to support his idea. This went on to be influential for many centuries.</p>

						 <p>On this open page, there is an image of a woman with a serene expression on her face. The title below describes it as a depiction of “Joy with Tranquillity”.</p>

						 <p>Underneath the image, a short caption reads: “Very little alteration is remarked in the face of those that feel within themselves the sweetness of joy.”</p>

						 <p>This suggests that the lack of any stronger expression was regarded positively. Le Brun’s work went on to declare that it was possible to judge the moral character of a person based on the way they expressed their passions. </p>

						 <p>Le Brun was, like many other 17th-century thinkers of the time, interested in rationalising, ordering and explaining the world around him. By giving names and definitions to subjective human experiences, they set in motion the deeply rooted concept of human expression as universal, and position these expressions within a hierarchy of good and bad, a system which we are still grappling with to this day.</p>

		                    <p>Millions of people participate in yoga classes globally, seeking to centre themselves with this physical and meditative exercise. Yoga has been practised for thousands of years in what today is known as the Middle East and South Asia, but it is now largely divorced from its philosophical origins.</p>

							<p>Interest in yoga in Europe and the US started in the early 20th century, as fitness regimes grew in popularity. These projected films from the 1950s show bodies performing poses, moving in strange, synchronised harmony and then stopping abruptly. The Yogi Swami Dev Murti, who appears here, travelled the world performing and teaching yoga to predominantly white audiences.</p>

							<p>The wellness industry is a multibillion-dollar economy. This oversized palo santo wood sculpture – burned as incense for its stress-relieving and cleansing properties – references the rapid deforestation in parts of South America. The large crystal lamp represents the unethical mining of natural crystals, fuelled by increasing consumer demand for these indigenous resources-turned-wellness products. Kaur brings our attention to social injustice within these exotifying practices. She asks us to consider who is exploited by acts of careless self-care.</p>

	                     <p>Here inside my installation, it looks and sounds like a strange yoga studio or wellness retreat, where things do not appear as expected. See-through curtains enclose and soften the space, and have vintage films of people practising yoga projected onto them.</p>

						 <p>Some of the films have been hand-tinted with colour and sepia tones. These projected bodies move in strange choreographies, sometimes are synchronised, and sometimes stop abruptly and switch to another surface or disappear, to be replaced with a colour: red, yellow, brown. The colours are linked to chromotherapy, the practice of using colour to balance the body and heal it from ailments.</p>

						 <p>There is a black-and-white film of the yogi Swami Dev Murti. He occupies his own space in the periphery of the room, and the intensity of his movements are sometimes beautiful and at other points disturbing.</p>

						 <p>He is the only person of colour. In all the other films the people are white. Words that you might hear in a yoga class such as: “bring your attention to” and “breathe”, are edited in with others such as “fetishisation”, “saffronisation”, “commercialisation”, around the frame of the film, disrupting the images and making reference to the colonial gaze inherent in the footage.</p>

						 <p>This suggests that the lack of any stronger expression was regarded positively. Le Brun’s work went on to declare that it was possible to judge the moral character of a person based on the way they expressed their passions. </p>

						 <p>Unavoidably large sculptures of commercially branded wellness products sit in the space. They are faux versions of the real deal, adding to the sticky questions of authenticity. In the centre of the room is an oversized glowing crystal lamp. The lamp would be normally something you would see at a much smaller scale. Here it is scaled up to the size of a person, ridiculous but also seductive at the same time.</p>
						 <p>When objects or practices are removed from bodies of colour, they become palatable and desirable. One of the gallery walls is wallpapered with a large image of Trayambakeshwar Temple in Rishikesh, India, which is now a popular yoga destination due to the site’s historically spiritual significance. It is a photograph that thousands of people have taken on yoga retreats that now circulates under hashtags on the internet. I have used a copy purchased from a stock-image website, suggesting a superficial and capitalist relationship to the location.</p>
						 <p>The installation is furnished with benches made from marbled yoga mats and foam blocks. You are invited to sit on the benches and get comfortable, listen to the soothing soundtrack and reflect. I want to draw your attention to who really enables these spaces of wellbeing? Whose labour is invisible? Whose histories are erased? And what does it mean to practise so-called self-care at the expense of others?</p>

			        <h4>Balancing Act</h4>
			        <p>What are the routines people have developed to manage their own wellbeing through the ages? This gallery unites historic and contemporary objects from several cultures that illustrate the search for tranquillity. From looking within to focusing attention outwards beyond the self, these objects address themes of spirituality, flow and reflection.</p>

					<p>Diary writing can help us to process our thoughts, and going for a walk in nature can stimulate greater connection to the world around us. Some people turn to their faith in their journey for internal peace. Such approaches can offer a break from anxiety and restlessness, and provide moments for recovery.</p>

					<p>In the ancient practice of humoral medicine, the body was composed of four humours that corresponded to the four elements of the universe. It was believed these humours had to be kept in balance with the cosmos in order to stay healthy. While our understanding of healthcare has changed over the centuries, the connections between our body and our surroundings still resonate powerfully today.</p>

						<p>This colourful print from Sri Lanka shows a scene from the Buddha’s life on the path to enlightenment. It is mythologised as a great battle with Māra, the evil demon that tries to stop him with an army of monsters. The Buddha’s calmness and connection to the earth are in direct opposition to an explosion of movement and objects that attack him. According to Buddhist theology, Māra’s battle represents the struggle we each face daily to see things how they really are, not confined by fear, distraction and our own ego.</p>

						<p>This medieval manuscript was made for a noble French family, and it was passed down and annotated by several generations of women. The book contains advice on how to achieve equilibrium by regulating the ‘non-naturals’ – things such as sleep, exercise and food. The passions of the soul were included among the non-naturals, and too much of one particular passion was believed to lead to ill health.</p>

	                    <p>In the religious tradition of Taoism, everything is a balance of opposites. The yin and yang symbol represents contrary forces that complement each other. Love is impossible without anger, and pain and happiness are intertwined. These interactions are celebrated and seen as complementary rather than at odds with each other. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine regard the body as made up of yin and yang. To heal disease and prolong life, these elements need to be kept in a harmonious balance.</p>

	                     <p>We’re looking at one of the rarest and most precious objects in the Wellcome’s collection. It’s a folding almanac from the 15th century.</p><p>It was designed to be a portable object that would have been attached to a medical practitioner’s belt and carried around to help them diagnose patients. This almanac’s condition and exquisite detail show that it was a highly valuable object and was, possibly, never even used.</p>

						<p>When closed, the rectangular almanac fits in the palm of your hand. It is covered in an embroidered binding made of green-and-pink silk. When opened, it unfolds like a map and shows astrological tables with lunar and solar eclipses, and diagrams.</p>

						<p>On the unfolded page small circular diagrams show the lunar and solar eclipses dating between 1384 and 1462. They have been written in brown and gold and red ink, and at the centre of each one the sun or moon’s phases have been illustrated. On the other side of this page is an illustration of the zodiac man.</p>

						<p>In the medieval period the cosmos played an important role in the understanding of human health. Astrology and medicine were taught in parallel in universities. Medical treatment often began with enquiries about exactly when the patient fell ill, at what time in relation to the lunar or solar cycles. An almanac such as this would have helped a practitioner prescribe the best treatment for a patient.</p>
						<p>At this time the body was believed to be composed of four humours that corresponded to the four elements of the universe. It was believed these humours had to be kept in balance with the cosmos in order to stay mentally and physically healthy.</p>
						<p>While our understanding of healthcare has changed over the centuries, the connections between our body and our surroundings still resonate powerfully today.</p>

	                    <p>In this illustration a giant redwood tree towers above a small figure, symbolising its majesty. This particular species can grow over 100 metres and live for thousands of years. In response to mass felling of redwoods in the 19th century, there was public outcry. This galvanised support for the American conservation movement to demand the protection of forest land, which ultimately led to the establishment of national parks. </p>

	                    <p>This engraving represents Christian thinking about the proper and improper uses of the passions. They are chained together, connected at the top to reason, and below to love, representing the idea that all passions should be motivated by a virtuous love and held in check by reason.</p><p>Joy is represented by a woman holding a jug and a goblet, suggesting the risks of intoxication. The accompanying text by Senault taught that true joy can only be found in heaven.</p>

	                    <p>This is an Islamic medical encyclopedia transcribed in Isfahan, Iran, in 1632. It contains the research of the physician Abu Ali Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna), who lived between 980 and 1037 CE, and remained a medical authority for centuries. The page opening shows an anatomical drawing of the digestive and nervous system, which was where he considered psychological problems such as grief and melancholy to originate. This theory resonates with contemporary research into the connection between intestinal and mental health. </p>

	                     <p>The shaping of emotional experience through internal changes in the body has long been recognised. In 1894, the American philosopher William James argued that the mental aspects of emotion, the “feeling states”, are a product of physiology – or the body’s internal signals.</p>

						<p>Our heart does not pound because we are afraid; fear arises from our pounding heart.</p>

						<p>Similarly, feelings of optimism and happiness have also been connected to changes in the body. Both heart-rate deceleration and heart-rate acceleration are observed in happiness and joy. High heart rate variability or HRV, which is the variation in the time interval between heartbeats, is associated with resilience and the potential to be both optimistic and stoical at times of adversity.</p>

						<p>How the body is today can also predict emotions tomorrow; higher rates of HRV can predict optimism levels in the future.</p>

						<p>Experiments also show that how we perceive internal bodily sensations influences how we experience emotions. As emotional feelings are thought to arise, in part, through the sensing of internal bodily changes, those individuals who are better able to sense bodily sensations, a process known as interoception, tend to experience emotions with greater intensity.</p>

						<p>Every time our heart beats, it sends a signal to our brain, so our brains are in constant and dynamic communication with our internal bodily organs. In addition to this “neural sensing” of our hearts, we can also sense them consciously – where we may suddenly become aware of their pounding, or of a skipped beat.</p>
						<p>And these changes in how our heart beats – and our neural and conscious perception of these – can help shape our emotional feeling states. That acceleration of our heart to pure joy can contribute to feelings of happiness.</p>

						<p>So, next time you feel a strong emotion, take a moment to sense associated bodily changes. Could these be contributing to how you are feeling?</p>

	                  	  <p>This book is believed to be a copy of the 17th-century Chinese encyclopedia ‘San-ts’ai t’u-hu’. It is open on a diagram depicting the ‘ruler’ of all organs, the heart, which is understood to be both the reflective and the emotional centre of a human being. In traditional Chinese medicine, different feelings are associated with different organs, and joy is located in the heart.</p>
